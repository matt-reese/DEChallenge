First, the assumption is that a Python 3.7 interpreter is installed. If not, Homebrew can be used to install Python 3.7.

Navigate to this data-engineering directory in a command line (in my case, in Terminal on macOS).
After that, run the command

pip install pipenv

This will install pipenv.
Create a virtual environment with the required packages for this project by then running

pipenv install

This should install all of the dependencies needed to run the script matching_active_users.py into a virtual environment.
Now, run the command

pipenv run python matching_active_users.py

from inside the data-engineering project directory, and the project should run as intended.
